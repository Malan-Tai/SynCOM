# SynCOM

A tactical turn-based combat game whose core is the relationships between units and their cooperation.

In a fantasy 20s New York, you run a mafia of merciless orcs, elves and dwarfs.
Recruit new units, select a mission on the map, build the most powerful team and go on a mission to defeat all your enemies.
Different classes have access to different special skills named Duo Abilities : those abilities must be launched use two of your unit's action, but are far more useful.
Each unit is unique thanks to a batch of traits that influence their stats in combat and the way their sentiments toards other change.
Beware of your units' relationships : two friends will work better together, but rivals might refuse to cooperate.
Use your tacticam skills to complet the mission and get one step closer to taking the control of the city !
